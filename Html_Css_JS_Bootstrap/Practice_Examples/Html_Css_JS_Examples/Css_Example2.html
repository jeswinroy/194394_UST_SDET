    <p id="first"><strong>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or
            entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have
            attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis
            (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.For our company to
            become as we are today, our experts have spent most of their time on dog research. They also have spent most
            of their time seeking recommendations, commendations and guidance from various experts when it comes to
            taking care of pets. We use every possible way that we can to provide the best dog products for our clients.

    <h2><strong>Why we do it?</strong></h2>
    <p id="third"><strong>There are many health benefits of owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise,
            get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol
            levels, and triglyceride levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship.
            Most households in the United States have at least one pet.

            Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets can increase fitness, lower stress, and bring
            happiness to their owners. Some of the health benefits of having a pet include:
            <ul2>
                <li>Decreased blood pressure</li><br>
                <li>Decreased cholesterol levels</li><br>
                <li>Decreased triglyceride levels</li><br>
                <li>Decreased feelings of loneliness</li><br>
                <li>Increased opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities</li><br>
                <li>Increased opportunities for socialization</li><br>
            </ul2>
